# Stock_Prediction

This project uses a simple Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for predicting stock prices. It fetches historical data and uses a neural network to learn patterns and forecast future stock prices.

## Process
- Preprocesses and scales the data
- Builds and trains an LSTM model
- Visualizes actual vs predicted prices
- Plots training loss curves

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- yfinance
